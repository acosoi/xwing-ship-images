Images of ships from X-Wing: The Miniatures Game by Fantasy Flight Games

Most data and images for X-Wing: The Miniatures Game are available at [xwing-data](https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data) by [Guido Kessels](https://github.com/guidokessels), however the repository is missing images of actual ships.

Once this repository includes images of all of the ships in the game, I'll be creating a pull request for `xwing-data` and hopefully merge them into the main branch.

All images are 256 x 256 PNGs with transparent backgrounds.
